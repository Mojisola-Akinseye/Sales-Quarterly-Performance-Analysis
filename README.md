# Sales Quarterly Performance Optimization and Insights Dashboard for Maven Technology

# Project Overview
## Background:
Maven Technology is a B2B company specializing in selling computer hardware to large-scale businesses. They have recently integrated a CRM system to track their sales opportunities. However, sales managers and other stakeholders currently lack visibility into the data for performance insights outside of the CRM. In their quest to become a fully data-driven organization, Maven Technology is looking to implement an interactive dashboard. This dashboard will allow sales managers to monitor their teams' performance on a quarterly basis, providing crucial insights that will enable them to make informed decisions and improve their sales processes.

## Objectives:
The project aims to utilize the sales data to generate actionable insights that will enable Maven Technology's management team to:

- Evaluate Team Performance: Analyze how each sales team is performing compared to others, identifying both high and low performers.
- Sales Agent Analysis: Identify if any sales agents are lagging in performance and require support or training.
- Trend Analysis: Detect quarter-over-quarter trends in sales performance, helping to predict future outcomes and adjust strategies accordingly.
- Product Performance: Determine if certain products or series have higher win rates, guiding future focus and promotional efforts.
- Sector Demand: Identify which sectors are purchasing products more frequently, allowing Maven Technology to refine their target strategies for maximum growth.

## Key Questions:
The following critical questions will guide the project and help meet the company's strategic goals:

1. How is each sales team performing compared to the rest?
2. Are any sales agents underperforming, and if so, who are they?
3. Can we identify trends in sales performance quarter-over-quarter?
4. Which products are showing the highest win rates?
5. Which sectors are driving the greatest demand for Maven Technology's products?
